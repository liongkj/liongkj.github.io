A comprehensive solar panel monitoring and management system featuring real-time data visualization, automated reporting, and predictive analytics.

**Technologies**: Python, Angular, Cypress, Redis, SQL, Thingsboard, Docker, Digital Ocean, Nginx, FastAPI, Flask

#### Key Accomplishments

- **Deployment Excellence**: Streamlined the deployment process, achieving deployment time of under 3 minutes and integrating frontend testing tools to minimize production errors

- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented query caching using Redis to alleviate the server load on Thingsboard, optimizing website performance for Vietnamese clientele. Resulted in faster loading speed and reduced network latency

- **Query Optimization**: Applied query optimization techniques, such as query statement rewriting and efficient query syntax, to enhance the execution plans and significantly improve query response time

- **IoT Device Provisioning**: Participated in the development of a web-based self-provisioning wizard for edge IoT devices ([View Screenshot](/screenshot/config-wizard.jpg)), collaborating with a team to create a configuration server. Simplified the deployment process, enabling on-site technicians to handle the setup, while allowing remote work for company engineers during large-scale deployments (over 500 edge devices)
