### Software Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer
**Advanced Vision Analytics Pte Ltd, Singapore** | *May 2022 - January 2023*

During my Master's program, I worked as a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer at AVA, where I:

#### SolarSens Platform Development
- Designed and optimized data visualization for SolarSENS, developing the dashboard and its modules including automated meter reading, bill generation, inverter control scheduling, and work orders
- Performed data retrieval, analysis, and caching to generate accurate business dashboards and visual reports
- Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict energy loss in solar panels' efficiency

#### Technical Achievements
- **Deployment Optimization**: Streamlined deployment process, achieving deployment time of under 3 minutes and integrating frontend testing tools to minimize production errors
- **Performance Enhancement**: Implemented query caching using Redis to alleviate server load on Thingsboard, optimizing website performance for Vietnamese clientele, resulting in faster loading speed and reduced network latency
- **Query Optimization**: Applied query optimization techniques including statement rewriting and efficient query syntax to enhance execution plans and significantly improve query response time
- **IoT Device Management**: Developed a web-based self-provisioning wizard for edge IoT devices, creating a configuration server that simplified deployment and enabled on-site technicians to handle setup during large-scale deployments (over 500 edge devices)

#### Machine Learning Module
- Developed ETL pipeline to gather data from over 800 edge devices across Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and optimize data visualization in SolarSens
- Co-designed and implemented ML algorithms for data analysis, including energy prediction models to estimate efficiency loss in solar panels due to shading and dirt accumulation

**Technologies**: Python, Angular, Cypress, Redis, SQL, Thingsboard, Docker, Digital Ocean, Nginx, FastAPI, Flask, Scikit-learn, eCharts
