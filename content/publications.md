## Conference Publications

### Unveiling Vulnerability of Self-Attention
**Khai Jiet Liong**, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao

*COLING 2024 - The 30th International Conference on Computational Linguistics*

This work investigates the vulnerabilities in self-attention mechanisms, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks on natural language processing models. We present novel insights into how self-attention layers can be exploited and propose methods to understand their robustness.
